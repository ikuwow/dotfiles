# Absolute path to nvim binary.
# Neovide falls back to PATH lookup when unset, but on macOS GUI launch
# (Finder/Dock) the login-shell PATH resolution can be unreliable (see
# neovide/neovide#3243). Hardcoding the path works around this.
# Adjust for Intel Mac (/usr/local/bin/nvim) or Linux if needed.
neovim-bin = "/opt/homebrew/bin/nvim"
